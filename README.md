This repository contains an example of a common ActionScript 3 error: the null object reference error.  The `bug.as` file demonstrates the error, while `bugSolution.as` provides a solution.  The error occurs when attempting to access a property or method of an object that has not yet been initialized or is null. This is a frequent issue in ActionScript and object-oriented programming in general. The solution emphasizes proper null checks and conditional logic before accessing object properties.
